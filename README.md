This is a terminal emulator that connects to remote shells using
a protocol built on cross-document messaging. The philosophy and
scope of this project can be described as follows:
- Be a good terminal emulator (built on `xtermjs`)
- Leverage secure technologies in the browser
- Evolve toward connectedness, and not complexity
